<H1>Cavalier King Charles</h1>

<P class="Indented">Hey, my name is Guy Peek and I have always loved dogs.  My favorite dog would have to be the Cavalier King Charles.  My family has two of them at home and they have been the best pets we have ever had.  I took some time to learn more about these great dogs and make a webpage with my findings.</P>

<p> Three Facts</p>
1. Nicknamed "The Comforter Spaniel" <br> 2. Named after King Charles II of Britain  <br>3. Despite being spaniels, Kennel clubs classify Cavaliers as toy dogs.
</div>
<p> The Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a small spaniel classed as a toy dog by The Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club.[2] It originated in the United Kingdom and is one of the more popular breeds in many countries. The King Charles changed inordinately in the late 17th century, when it was interbred with flat-nosed breeds. Until the 1920s, the Cavalier shared the same history as the smaller King Charles Spaniel. Breeders attempted to recreate what they considered to be the original configuration of the breed, a dog resembling Charles II's King Charles Spaniel of the Restoration.</P>
<p> I also researched information about the colors of the breed. Here is my findings: The breed has four recognized colours. Cavaliers which have rich chestnut markings on a pearly white background are known as Blenheim in honour of Blenheim Palace, where John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, raised the predecessors to the Cavalier breed in this particular colour. In some dogs there is a chestnut spot in the middle of the forehead: this is called the "blenheim" spot. </P>
